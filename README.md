Topic: Fast and Accurate PPA Modelling Using Transfer Learning


Abstract—Power, Performance and Area(PPA) needs to be
considered while developing a System-On-Chip to improve performance, durability and reliability. This paper focuses on an
accurate PPA estimation using Machine Learning models like
Neural Networks, Decision Trees and Gradient Boost Regressor
where Transfer Learning is used to train the model. Transfer
Learning achieves a high prediction accuracy with a constrained
number of samples and also reduces the time complexity by using
pre-trained models. A comparative study of the different models
is also presented in this paper. An accuracy of up to 98% can
be achieved with the proposed models.
